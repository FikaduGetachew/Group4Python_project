# README: Student Management System

This Python program allows for the management of student records through functionalities such as registration, search, display, and updates. The interaction with student data is facilitated by reading and writing to the "student_db.txt" file where the information is stored. Below are the key features and instructions related to using the system.
## Features:
1. Registration:
    - Add new student information to the database, ensuring unique student IDs are entered.
2. Search Student:
    - Locate and display detailed student data based on provided student ID.
3. Show All Students:
    - Display the complete list of students with their IDs, names, GPAs, departments, and genders.
4. Update GPA:
    - Update a student's GPA by entering the student ID and the new GPA value within the valid range (0-4).
5. File Handling:
    - The program reads and writes to the "student_db.txt" file to manage student records.

## Instructions:
1. Setup:
    - Ensure the Python environment is set up to execute the program.
    - Place the student_db.txt file in the same directory as the Python script.

2. Running the Program:
    - Execute the program in the command-line interface or a Python IDE environment.
    - Follow the on-screen prompts and menu options to perform various operations on student data.

3. Funcionality Overview:
    - Menu Navigation:
        - Navigate the menu options to select desired operations like registration, search, update, or display.
    - Error Handling:
        - Potential program errors like file not found or incorrect input values are captured and displayed.

4. Dependencies:
    - The program has no specific external dependencies and should run on standard Python environments.

## Sample Usage:
1. Register multiple students with unique IDs, along with their names, GPAs, departments, and genders.
2. Search for specific students using their student ID.
3. Update the GPA of a student by providing the student ID and the new GPA value.
4. View the complete list of students with their details.
